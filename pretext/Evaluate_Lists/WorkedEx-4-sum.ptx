            Problem: Assume that the integer list <c>alpha</c> has been properly initialized with non-zero values.
            What does this code accomplish?
        </p>


        <program language="python">
            <input>
sum = 0
for value in alpha:
    sum += value
            </input>
        </program>

        <title>SG1: Declaring and initialization of list</title>

        <p>
            There is no explicit declaration or initialization of an list within the code.
            However, the instructions describe that the list <c>alpha</c> has been properly initialized with non-zero values.

                        This figure shows a table with 6 columns and 2 rows.
                        The top row is labeled with the indexes of the list, and the bottom row is labeled with the values of the list, which are currently blank.
                        The first index is 0, and the last index is size-1.

            <p>
                Within the loop, we are accessing list elements by value.
            </p>


            <program language="python">
                <input>
for value in alpha:
                </input>
            </program>

            <p>
                In each iteration of the loop, the variable <c>value</c> is assigned the value of the list element at index <c>i</c>.
                The first iteration of the loop assigns the value of the first element in the list to <c>value</c>, and so on.
                The loop continues until all elements in the list have been accessed.

                Let us trace with a sample list.

                        This figure shows a table with 6 columns and 2 rows.
                        The top row is labeled with the indexes of the list, and the bottom row is labeled with the values of the list.
                        The first index is 0, and the last index is size-1.
                        The values row is now populated with the values 12, 22, 8, 15, 2.

            <p>
                The first line of the code sample initializes <c>sum</c> to a have a value of zero, and then a for-loop is used to traverse the list.
                The chart below uses one line to represent the memory and calculations during each iteration of the loop, starting when <c>i</c> has a value of zero.

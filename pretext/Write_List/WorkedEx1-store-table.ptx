    <title>Worked Example: Writing Lists - Storing Multiplication Table</title>

    <subsection>
        <p>
            Problem: Write the Python code to store the multiplication table for the value 13.
            The first element should be 0 (13 * 0), the second element should be 13 (13 * 1), the third element should be 26 (13 * 2), etc.
            There should be a total of 51 elements in the list, representing the numbers 0 through 50.

        <title>SG1: Instantiating a list variable</title>

        <p>
            We will name the variable <c>mult13</c>.
            The list will be instantiated with a sequence of 51 numbers from 0 to 50.
            We will use the <c>range</c> function to generate the numbers from 0 to 50, incrementing by 1 each time, and then convert the range to a list.
        </p>


        <program language="python">
            <input>
mult13 = list(range(51))
            </input>
        </program>

        <title>SG5: Traversing a list</title>

        <p>
            Before we actually access or update the list (SG3 and SG4), it is important for us to realize that we will need to update all the elements of the list.
            As currently instantiated the list <c>mult13</c> has the values 0, 1, 2, ..., 50.
            So we will first discuss the traversal of the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will be traversing the entire list, updating all the elements.
            Because we will be updating the values within the list, we need to use the <c>range</c> function to generate the indices based on the length of the list.
        </p>


        <program language="python">
            <input>
for i in range(len(mult13)):
            </input>
        </program>

        <title>SG4: Changing the value of a list element</title>

        <p>
            Inside the loop, we want to change the current value stored in that list element (at index <c>i</c>).
            The expression for the RHS, should be the literal value 13 multiplied by the loop control variable (<c>i</c>).
            So the statement inside the loop should be:
        </p>


        <program language="python">
            <input>
mult13[i] = 13 * i
            </input>
        </program>
    </subsection>

        <answer>
            <program language="python">
                <input>
mult13 = list(range(51))
for i in range(len(mult13)):
    mult13[i] = 13 * i
                </input>
            </program>

            <p>
                To verify we have the correct values, we can print out the values of the list:
            </p>


            <program language="python">
                <input>
for i in range(len(mult13)):
    print("13 *", i, "is", mult13[i])
                </input>
            </program>

            <p>
                Although we are only accessing the values in the list, we still need to use the <c>range</c> function to generate the indices based on the length of the list.
                This is because we want to print the number that 13 is multiplied by (which is identical to the index).
                If we didn't want to print out the number, then we could simply use a <c>for</c> loop that traverses the list directly.

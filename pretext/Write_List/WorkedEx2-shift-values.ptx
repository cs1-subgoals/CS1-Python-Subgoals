    <title>Worked Example: Writing Lists - Shifting List Values</title>
    <xi:include href='./subgoals_write_list.ptx' />
    <subsection>
        <p>Problem: You were to write the Python code that will declare a list of integers with 
            the values  5, 10, 15, â€¦ 55 (multiples of 5). But then you remember you were 
            supposed to start at 1, not 5 - so write the Python code that will shift all the 
            values to the right by 1. In other words, the value 5 will shift from index 0 to index 1. 
            And then you can put the value 1 at index 0.</p>

        <title>SG1: Instantiating a list variable</title>
        <p>We will use the generic name <c>alpha</c> for the list variable, because we do not know anything else about the list in this case.</p>
        <p>The list should start with the multiples of five, skipping over the 0.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
alpha = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]
        </input></program>

        <title>SG4: Adding or changing value of a list element</title>
        <p>
            To shift the values to the right, we just need to insert a new value at the
            beginning of the list. We can use the <c>insert</c> method to insert the value
            <c>1</c> at index <c>0</c>.
        </p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
alpha.insert(0, 1)
            </input>
        </program>

            <program language="python">
                <input>
alpha = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]
alpha.insert(0, 1)
                </input>
            </program>

            <p>
                To verify we have the correct values, we can print out the values of the list:
            </p>


            <program language="python">
                <input>
print(alpha)
                </input>
            </program>

            <p>
                Since we do not need to do anything with the values, we can just print the entire list out all at once.

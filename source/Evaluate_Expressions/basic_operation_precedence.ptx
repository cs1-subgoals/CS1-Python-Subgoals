        <p>Given the following code snippet, evaluate the final statement (the last line). If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what value is assigned to the variable? Note any possible side effects.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
alpha = 3
beta = 1
delta = 3
omega = 2.5
theta = -1.3
kappa = 2.0

mu = alpha / kappa + delta

        <p>The expression is the right-hand-side (RHS) of the statement: <c>alpha / kappa + delta</c>. In this expression, division has a higher precedence than summation, so we first evaluate <c>alpha / kappa</c>. Then, we will evaluate the addition of <c>delta</c> to that result.</p>

        <p>The expression <c>alpha / kappa</c> is a division between an integer (<c>alpha</c>) and a float (<c>kappa</c>). That is a valid operation, and will produce a float. That float will be added to <c>delta</c>, which is an integer. Adding together a float and an integer is also valid, and will produce a float.</p>

        <p>The variable <c>alpha</c> is substituted for the value <c>3</c> and the variable <c>kappa</c> is substituted for the value <c>2.0</c>. Dividing them produces the float <c>1.5</c>. The value of <c>delta</c> (3) is then added to the result, for a total of <c>4.5</c>. This value is stored in <c>mu</c>.</p>

                <p>
                    Is the left-hand-side (LHS) of the statement a variable? What type?
                </p>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        Yes, the variable <c>mu</c> will be a float.
                    </p>
                </answer>

            <li>
                <p>
                    What is the resulting type after evaluating the right-hand-side (RHS)?
                </p>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        A float.
                    </p>
                </answer>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Would dividing <c>kappa</c> by <c>alpha</c> instead change the resulting type?
                </p>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        Although it would change its value, it would not change its type. Division with / always produces a float.

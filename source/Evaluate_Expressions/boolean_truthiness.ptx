alpha = 0
beta = 1
gamma = 5

    <title>SG1: Decide order of operations</title>
    <p>The two operators in this expression are the <c>></c> and <c>or</c> (boolean logical OR). The <c>or</c> operator has a very low precedence, much lower than any of the comparison operators. Therefore, the comparison will be evaluated first, followed by the logical <c>or</c>.</p>

    <title>SG2: Determine operator behavior based on operands</title>
     <p>The <c>alpha</c> and <c>beta</c> variables are integers, which are valid operands for the <c>></c> comparison. That expression evaluates to a boolean. That boolean and the integer variable <c>gamma</c> will be used for operands for the <c>or</c> operator. The <c>or</c> operator allows basically any type of value to be used, with the result type dependent on which operand evaluates to True (from left to right). So the <c>or</c> will evaluate either to a boolean (because of its left operand, the result of the <c>></c> operation) or an integer (because of its right operand <c>gamma</c>).</p>

            <li>
                <p>In the first comparison, <c>alpha</c> is substituted for <c>0</c> and <c>beta</c> is substituted for <c>1</c>. Then, the <c>></c> determines if <c>0</c> is greater than <c>1</c>, which it is not. Therefore, the expression evaluates to <c>False</c>.</p>
                <p>The boolean value <c>False</c> is used as the right operand. Each operand will be checked from left to right, with the result being the first operand that evaluates to <c>True</c> according to the rules of Truthiness. Since <c>False</c> is nota value that evaluates to True in truthiness rules, the second operand is checked. The value <c>5</c> is a Truthy value (any non-zero integer is considered True for the purposes of Truthiness), so <c>5</c> is the value that is assigned to <c>result</c>.</p>

                <p>
                    Would putting parentheses around <c>beta or gamme</c> change the result?
                </p>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        Yes, but not in the way you might expect. The expression <c>beta or gamme</c> will be evaluated first, and produce an integer (specifically <c>1</c> since that is a Truthy value). Then, that result will be used as the right operand to the <c>></c> comparison, resulting in a boolean value (<c>False</c>, since <c>0 > 1</c>).

                     <p>
                        What expression would actually ask the question, "is either beta or gamma greater than alpha?"  
                    </p>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        You would need to repeat the comparison as <c>alpha > beta or alpha > gamma</c>
                    </p>

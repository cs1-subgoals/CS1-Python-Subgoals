        <p>Given the following code snippet, evaluate the final statement (the last line). If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what value is assigned to the variable?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
alpha = 2
beta = 1
delta = 3
omega = 2.5
theta = -1.3
kappa = 3.0

gamma = delta / (alpha + beta) % alpha
<!--result = beta <= alpha This line is causing an error, below too, so appears to be with the <= characters-->
</input></program>

    <title>SG1: Decide order of operations</title>
    <p>The expression is the right-hand-side (RHS) of the statement: <c> delta /(alpha + beta) % alpha</c>. In this expression, the parentheses have the highest priority, so the addition inside of the parentheses will be evaluated first. Then, since division and modulo have the same priority, the division with <c>delta</c> will occur next, with the result module the final <c>alpha</c></p>

    <p>The expression <c>alpha + beta</c> is an addition between two integers, so will result in an integer. The subsequent division between <c>delta</c> (an integer) and that new integer will result in a float, since the float division operator is used. The final modulo will be between a float and an integer, which will produce a float.</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-op-precSG3">
    <title>SG3: Solve arithmetic, expression, or operation</title>
    <p>The variable <c>alpha</c> is substituted for the value <c>2</c> and the variable <c>beta</c> is substituted for the value <c>1</c>. Adding them produces the integer <c>3</c>.</p>
    <p>The value of <c>delta</c> (3) is then used as the divisor, for the dividend of <c>1.0</c>.</p>
    <p>Then, the last <c>alpha</c> is substituted for <c>2</c>, and <c>1.0 % 2</c> is calculated, with the final remainder of <c>1.0</c>.</p>
    <p>The value <c>1.0</c> is stored in <c>gamma</c></p>

    <title>Questions to check understanding</title>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the left-hand-side (LHS) of the statement a variable? What type?
            </p>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Yes, the variable <c>gamma</c> will be a float.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                What is the resulting type after evaluating the right-hand-side (RHS)?
            </p>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    A float.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Would dividing using the <c>//</c> operator instead of the <c>/</c> operator change the type of the result?
            </p>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Yes, since the result of that division would be an integer (<c>3</c>), and all the other operations involved integers.
                </p>
